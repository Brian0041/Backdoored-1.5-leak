# Backdoored-1.5-leak
Yeah the code is pretty trash, we completely rewrote half of the codebase between 1.6/1.7, and that isnt included.

Also please keep in mind that all of the code in this repository is being released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, and you should adhere to that.

If you want to support the developers please join the discord linked at http://backdoored.github.io , the client costs 20$ worth of bitcoin.

## Why?
People started selling this. I dont want any of the hardwork my dev team has put in to be sold by other people.

## Wheres the source code? This is decompiled.
While not obfuscated, yes, this is decompiled code, and doesnt include stuff like formatting and comments and also tragically has brackets on the same line.

This is what is being sold. Thats all Im going to release. Im not gonna spread anything that wasnt already being spread.

## Why didnt you searge map
Anyone who isnt a worthless skid will be able to map them themselves.
