I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I know words. I have the best words.\n\nIf Trump Ipsum werenâ€™t my own words, perhaps Iâ€™d be dating it. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.\n\nLorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card.\n\nIf Trump Ipsum werenâ€™t my own words, perhaps Iâ€™d be dating it. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.\n\nItâ€™s about making placeholder text great again. Thatâ€™s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again.\n\nI will write some great placeholder text â€“ and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me â€“ and Iâ€™ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your websiteâ€™s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. When other websites give you text, theyâ€™re not sending the best. Theyâ€™re not sending you, theyâ€™re sending words that have lots of problems and theyâ€™re bringing those problems with us. Theyâ€™re bringing mistakes. Theyâ€™re bringing misspellings. Theyâ€™re typistsâ€¦ And some, I assume, are good words.\n\nThat other text? Sadly, itâ€™s no longer a 10. When other websites give you text, theyâ€™re not sending the best. Theyâ€™re not sending you, theyâ€™re sending words that have lots of problems and theyâ€™re bringing those problems with us. Theyâ€™re bringing mistakes. Theyâ€™re bringing misspellings. Theyâ€™re typistsâ€¦ And some, I assume, are good words. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that Iâ€™m more honest and my words are more beautiful.\n\nDoes everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.\n\nYouâ€™re disgusting. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that Iâ€™m more honest and my words are more beautiful.\n\nI don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. You know, it really doesnâ€™t matter what you write as long as youâ€™ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.\n\nYou have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. That other text? Sadly, itâ€™s no longer a 10. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.\n\nHeâ€™s not a word hero. Heâ€™s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasnâ€™t captured.";
